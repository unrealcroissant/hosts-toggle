# hosts-toggle
Simple shell scripts intended for use with Steven Black's unified block list hosts script: https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts

These shell scripts perform a simple check to see if the hosts file is already disabled before attempting to enable/disable it.

**Installation**

Simply place these scripts wherever you like to keep your scripts (say, `~/Documents/.scripts` for instance). You can run them directly from their directory or you can alias them for easier use.
